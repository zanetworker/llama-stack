## Agents API (Experimental)

> **🧪 EXPERIMENTAL**: This API is in preview and may change based on user feedback. Great for exploring new capabilities and providing feedback to influence the final design.

Main functionalities provided by this API:

- Create agents with specific instructions and ability to use tools.
- Interactions with agents are grouped into sessions ("threads"), and each interaction is called a "turn".
- Agents can be provided with various tools (see the ToolGroups and ToolRuntime APIs for more details).
- Agents can be provided with various shields (see the Safety API for more details).
- Agents can also use Memory to retrieve information from knowledge bases. See the RAG Tool and Vector IO APIs for more details.
