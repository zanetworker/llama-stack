# Welcome to Llama Stack

Llama Stack is the open-source framework for building generative AI applications.

:::tip Llama 4 is here!

## What is Llama Stack?

Llama Stack defines and standardizes the core building blocks needed to bring generative AI applications to market. It provides a unified set of APIs with implementations from leading service providers, enabling seamless transitions between development and production environments. More specifically, it provides:

- **Unified API layer** for Inference, RAG, Agents, Tools, Safety, Evals.
- **Plugin architecture** to support the rich ecosystem of implementations of the different APIs in different environments like local development, on-premises, cloud, and mobile.
- **Prepackaged verified distributions** which offer a one-stop solution for developers to get started quickly and reliably in any environment
- **Multiple developer interfaces** like CLI and SDKs for Python, Node, iOS, and Android
- **Standalone applications** as examples for how to build production-grade AI applications with Llama Stack

Our goal is to provide pre-packaged implementations (aka "distributions") which can be run in a variety of deployment environments. LlamaStack can assist you in your entire app development lifecycle - start iterating on local, mobile or desktop and seamlessly transition to on-prem or public cloud deployments. At every point in this transition, the same set of APIs and the same developer experience is available.

## How does Llama Stack work?

Llama Stack consists of a server (with multiple pluggable API providers) and Client SDKs meant to be used in your applications. The server can be run in a variety of environments, including local (inline) development, on-premises, and cloud. The client SDKs are available for Python, Swift, Node, and Kotlin.
